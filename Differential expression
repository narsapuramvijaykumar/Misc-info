LRT - In statistics, a likelihood ratio test (LR test) is a statistical test used for comparing the goodness of fit of two statistical models 
â€” a null model against an alternative model. The test is based on the likelihood ratio, which expresses how many times more likely the data
are under one model than the other. This likelihood ratio, or equivalently its logarithm, can then be used to compute a p-value, 
or compared to a critical value to decide whether to reject the null model.
