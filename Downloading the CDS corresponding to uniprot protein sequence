This script will show steps to follow to download the CDS sequence corresponding to the Uniprot protein sequence
1. Select the set of Uniprot protein ids for which you would like to download the CDS (get uniprotKB AC/ID --> tr|A0A1B8CKU8|A0A1B8CKU8_9PEZI --> A0A1B8CKU8_9PEZI)
 grep ">" UNIPROT_fasta.fasta | awk '{print $1}' | cut -d'|' -f3 | less
   E.g. A0A1B8CKU8_9PEZI
        V9DF32_9EURO
        A0A1V1TAX9_9FUNG
        A0A1H1JFR0_9RHOB
2. Mapping the UniprotKB AC/ID to EMBL/DDBJ/GENBANK CDS using IDmapper in uniprot
E.g From	To
A0A1B8CKU8_9PEZI	OBT47437.1
V9DF32_9EURO	ETI25494.1
A0A1V1TAX9_9FUNG	GAW17986.1
A0A1H1JFR0_9RHOB	SDR48466.1

3. Searching the mapped ID's in NCBI "protein (drop-down)" resource (all ids at once using comma separated)

4. Now download the CDS sequence from send to --> file --> Fasta CDS (Check for sequence start with ATG, else follow step 6)

5. You have successfully downloaded the CDS for each of your corresponding Uniprot protein

6. If the CDS sequence doesn't start with the "ATG" then go to sms2(sequence manipulation suite) resource, select the select the reverse compliment section
   paste your CDS sequence and rev complement it and download the resulting file.
